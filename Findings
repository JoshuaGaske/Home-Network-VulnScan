📝 Home Network Vulnerability Assessment Report
Date: 05/28/2025
Scanner Used: Nessus Essentials
Target: Home Network

1️⃣ Scan Overview
The Nessus Essentials vulnerability scan was conducted on my home network to identify potential security risks and misconfigurations. The assessment primarily analyzed open ports, SSL configurations, and system vulnerabilities.
2️⃣ Summary of Findings
- Total vulnerabilities detected: 1 Medium, all others were Informational
- No critical or high-risk vulnerabilities were identified
- Most findings were related to open UDP ports
- SSL certificate issue flagged—but the warning originated from Nessus itself

3️⃣ Medium Vulnerability: SSL Certificate Warning
🔹 Vulnerability: Nessus Web Interface SSL Certificate Not Trusted
🔹 Affected Port: 8834/tcp (Nessus Web UI)
🔹 Description:
Nessus flagged its own self-signed SSL certificate as "not trusted," a common behavior for security scanners when accessing their web interface.
🔹 Risk Level: Medium (Expected Behavior)
- Since Nessus uses a self-signed SSL certificate, browsers and security tools may mark it as untrusted.
- This does not indicate an actual security weakness in the network.
🔹 Recommended Action:
- If desired, install a trusted CA-signed certificate for Nessus to eliminate this alert.
- Otherwise, no action is needed, as this is an expected behavior for local security scanners.

4️⃣ Informational Findings
Most additional findings were informational rather than security risks.
- Several UDP ports were detected as open, but no vulnerabilities were associated with them.
- This is normal for network communication and does not indicate a security flaw.
5️⃣ Next Steps & Conclusion
- ✅ No critical vulnerabilities were identified.
- ✅ The only flagged issue was an expected SSL warning from Nessus itself.
- 🔍 For deeper assessments, a credentialed scan or manual validation of open ports could be performed.
