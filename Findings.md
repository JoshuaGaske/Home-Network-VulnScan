# 🏠 Home Network Vulnerability Assessment Report

**📅 Date:** 05/28/2025  
**🛠 Scanner Used:** Nessus Essentials  
**🎯 Target:** Home Network  

---

## 🔍 1. Scan Overview  
This Nessus Essentials vulnerability scan was conducted to identify potential security risks and misconfigurations.  
The assessment primarily analyzed **open ports, SSL configurations, and system vulnerabilities**.

---

## 📌 2. Summary of Findings  
✅ **Total vulnerabilities detected:**  
- 🟠 **1 Medium Severity Issue**  
- 🔵 All others classified as **Informational**  

🔎 **Key Observations:**  
- **No critical or high-risk vulnerabilities detected.**  
- **Most findings were related to open UDP ports** (normal behavior).  
- **SSL certificate issue flagged**—but only from Nessus itself.  

---

## ⚠️ 3. Medium Severity: SSL Certificate Warning  

- **🔹 Vulnerability:** Nessus Web Interface SSL Certificate Not Trusted  
- **🔹 Affected Port:** `8834/tcp` (Nessus Web UI)  
- **🔹 Description:**  
  Nessus flagged its **own** self-signed SSL certificate as untrusted, which is expected behavior.  

📌 **Risk Level: Medium (Expected Behavior)**  
- Nessus uses a **self-signed SSL certificate**, so browsers and security tools may mark it as untrusted.  
- **No action is needed**, unless replacing it with a trusted CA-signed certificate for compliance reasons.  

---

## 📖 4. Informational Findings  

Most additional findings were **informational** rather than security risks:  
- Several **open UDP ports were detected**, but none had associated vulnerabilities.  
- Open ports are **normal for network communication** and not an immediate security issue.  

📌 **Example Findings:**  
| 🔢 Port  | 🔍 Protocol | 📝 Finding Summary |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `5353/udp` | **mDNS** | Normal multicast DNS activity |
| `1900/udp` | **UPnP** | Standard Universal Plug & Play discovery |
| `137/udp` | **NetBIOS** | Local network communication, expected behavior |

## 🚀 5. Next Steps & Conclusion  

✅ **No critical vulnerabilities were detected.**  
✅ The **only flagged issue was an expected Nessus SSL warning**—no actual risk.  
📌 **Optional follow-up actions:**  
- Perform **credentialed scans** for deeper assessments.  
- Investigate **port configurations** if security hardening is required.
