# Home Network Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus Essentials 🛡️  

## Overview  
This project documents my experience using **Nessus Essentials**, a free version of the **Nessus vulnerability scanner**, to assess security risks on my home network. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and explore remediation strategies to improve overall security posture.

## Objectives  
✅ Perform a full vulnerability scan on my home network  
✅ Identify critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities  
✅ Analyze CVEs and determine their potential impact  
✅ Research and document remediation actions for discovered vulnerabilities  
✅ Strengthen my understanding of vulnerability management principles  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Nessus Essentials** – Vulnerability scanning & CVE detection  
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** – Prioritization based on severity  
- **Windows/Linux Devices** – Endpoints scanned for vulnerabilities  
- **Firewall & Security Configurations** – Examined for potential weaknesses  

## Scan Methodology  
1. **Target Selection:** Scanned devices across my home network, including personal computers and IoT devices.  
2. **Scan Configuration:** Used Nessus Essentials with a **Basic Network Scan** template.  
3. **Analysis:** Reviewed CVEs and categorized vulnerabilities based on severity levels.  
4. **Remediation Planning:** Researched fixes, patches, and security best practices for identified vulnerabilities.  

## Findings Summary  
| **Severity**  | **Number of Vulnerabilities** | **Examples** |
|--------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | 0 vulnerabilities | (Unpatched OS flaw) |
| 🟠 **High** | 0 vulnerabilities | (Open ports exposure) |
| 🟡 **Medium** | 1 vulnerabilities | (Weak encryption protocols) |
| 🟢 **Low** | 0 vulnerabilities | (Minor misconfigurations) |


## Remediation Steps  
- **Applied security patches** for outdated software and OS vulnerabilities  
- **Reconfigured firewall rules** to block unnecessary open ports  
- **Updated encryption settings** for better network security  
- **Disabled unnecessary services** to reduce attack surface  

## Lessons Learned  
- **Regular vulnerability assessments** are crucial for security hygiene  
- **Patch management** plays a vital role in reducing risk exposure  
- **Network segmentation** can limit the impact of security breaches  
- **IoT devices** often introduce hidden security risks
